/**
 * Legacy password-authentication proof.
 *
 * The server never sees the password or the derived master key. The client
 * proves knowledge of the master key with a keyed hash of a fixed challenge:
 *
 *   proof     = HMAC-SHA256(masterKey, AUTH_CHALLENGE)
 *   proofHash = SHA-256(proof)
 *
 * The server stores proofHash and compares it on login. This keeps the password
 * and master key off the server and out of the vault-decryption path, but the
 * stored value equals what the client sends, so a leak of it is enough to
 * authenticate (it still cannot decrypt vault data). The Ed25519 challenge-
 * response scheme in ../auth-signing removes that property and supersedes this
 * one; this path remains only to read accounts that haven't migrated.
